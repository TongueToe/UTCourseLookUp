# UT Course Lookup Tool

[Le beaut](https://utcourselookup.herokuapp.com/)

## Shit To Do:
1. ~~Get the goddamn app.js to communicate to server.js~~ Finally transferred data by using GET params.
  * ~~Use JSON to pass objects since HTTP GET only transfers strings??~~
2. ~~Integrate MongoDB into this shit~~
  * ~~MongoLab on Heroku?? How to use???~~
  * ~~C# script to upload everything into mongo????~~
  * ~~Gotta learn mongo first lol~~
  * ~~JS scripts to retrieve database records (documents) from ugly strings -- look at previous C# proj for help~~
3. Bootstrap
  * Bootstrap magic -- forms, panels, & shit
  * Forms: Drop-down using ui-select???
  * ~~Try loading entire page first; if this takes too goddamn long, then take different approach~~ Bad
  * Bootstrap animations maybe??
4. Rando fucks
  * Look at routing again maybe?? lol

# Different Approach
1. 2 select inputs:
  1. Abbr (ex. BIO)
  2. Course No. (ex. 325)
2. 3 radio buttons:
  * Both upper and lower division
  * Upper only
  * Lower only
3. Bordered Divider
4. Display table
