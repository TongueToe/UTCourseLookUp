# UT Course Lookup Tool
## Shit To Do:
1. ~~Get the goddamn app.js to communicate to server.js~~ Finally transferred data by using GET params.
  * Use JSON to pass objects since HTTP GET only transfers strings??
2. Integrate MongoDB into this shit
  * ~~MongoLab on Heroku?? How to use???~~
  * ~~C# script to upload everything into mongo????~~
  * ~~Gotta learn mongo first lol~~
  * JS scripts to retrieve database records (documents) from ugly strings -- look at previous C# proj for help
3. Rando fucks
  * Bootstrap magic -- forms, panels, & shit
  * Different ways to query database: give only abbr, or abbr + upperDiv=true, etc.
  * Look at routing again maybe?? lol
